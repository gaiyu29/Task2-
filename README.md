The overview figures show a total profit of $286,397 on total sales of $2,297,201. A total of 37,873 items were sold, with total discounts given amounting to $1,561. These numbers provide a quick snapshot of overall performance.

Profit is highest in the Technology category. Products like phones and other tech devices drive most of the profit. In contrast, the Furniture category underperforms â€“ notably, tables are actually causing a loss (negative profit). Office Supplies fall in between. This means most profit comes from tech products, while furniture (especially tables) brings down the total.

Profit varies widely by state. The map highlights that some states contribute strong profits while others show weaker results. For example, large markets (like California and New York) tend to show higher profit, whereas many smaller states have much less. This geographic view makes it clear that performance differs significantly from state to state.

Each region (Central, East, South, West) has its own list of the top five customers by sales volume. These lists highlight the key accounts driving revenue in each area. In other words, the chart shows which customers are the biggest buyers locally, revealing that different regions rely on different major clients.

Sales are split across the four regions as follows:
West: 725,458 (highest share of total sales)
East: 678,781
Central: 501,240
South: 391,722 (lowest share of total sales)
